# inheritanceContract
Created simple inheritance contract with solidity

## Problem Statement
Create an inheritance smart contract in solidity. This smart contract should allow the owner to withdraw ETH from the contract. If the owner does not withdraw ETH from the contract for more than 1 month an heir can take control of the contract and designate a new heir. It should be possible for the owner to withdraw 0 ETH just to reset the one month counter.
